Yo, just finished watching Cleaner, and man, what a wild ride. You ever download the movie and just kinda feel like you’re in for something predictable and then boom, plot twist hits you like a brick? I mean, Samuel L. Jackson, right? Dude's just intense as ever. 

So there's this part where everything's all chill, and then suddenly, chaos. Classic. Keeps you on the edge, man. But seriously, some scenes were just dragging, like, get to the point already! You know what I mean? But then again, boom, plot twist number two, and I'm like, “Didn’t see that coming!” Reminds me why I love just sitting back and watch the movie like tonight.

> Oh, and the soundtrack, though! It’s like they know how to keep you vibing through the slow bits. You ever like a song so much you Shazam it in the middle of a movie? Haha, that’s me today.

But for real, the ending... not what I expected at all. Felt like it wrapped up too quickly, like they were running out of time or something. I was all, “Wait, that’s it?!” Just one of those moments where you gotta sit there and let it sink in. 

Anyway, what’s up with directors leaving open-ended stuff these days? It’s like they want us to write the next part or something. Can’t decide if it’s genius or lazy. But hey, it had its moments. Keeps you guessing, even when you're kinda over it. 

x = I have no idea why I'm even typing this, lol

But enough about that. Totally worth the watch though. Let’s catch up soon, yeah? Tell me what you’ve been up to!
